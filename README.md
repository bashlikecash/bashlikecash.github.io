# portfolio.github.io
For portfolio class Fall 2024

I want to add the color #F4EEDE as the background.

I want to use the font "Poppins" from google fonts; regular, 45.

I want to add the following text:
"Welcome, I'm Sebastian. 

I sprouted as a young, earnest artist with starry eyes and a menagerie of hobbies and random supplies. As my curiosities have flourished I've nested comfortably into just calling myself an artist and allowing my work to change as I do. My most recent endeavor has been to study creative coding and sonic arts at Portland Community College."

I want to add at least three photos that can be clicked and dragged.

I want the page to be a vector so that it shrinks and grows as the screen does.

I would like to add a way to create a nav bar/button that links to other projects/repositories.

I would like to create a mobile compatible version.
